								<blockquote>
									Life (ayu) is the combination (samyoga) of body, senses, mind, and reincarnating soul. Ayurveda is the most sacred science of life, beneficial to humans both in this world and the world beyond. (R. Charaka)
								</blockquote>
								<blockquote>
									When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When diet is correct, medicine is of no need. (Ayurveda Quote)
								</blockquote>

								<p><strong>1. Milestones in the development of Ayurveda</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Ayurveda was derived from the Vedas, the compendium of ancient Indian knowledge. The Atharvaveda, or “fourth Veda” also mentions many medicinal plants and concepts from Ayurveda.</li>
									<li>The Charaka Samhita (1000 BC) and Sushruta Samhita (1000 BC) are the original texts of Ayurveda.</li>
									<li>The western system of medicine was introduced into India by the British in the 19th century. 
										In 1827, classes in Ayurvedic medicine began at the Government Sanskrit College, Calcutta. A five-year degree course in Ayurvedic medicine and 
										surgery was offered at Banaras Hindu University from 1927.</li>
									<li>In 1970, the Ayurvedic formulary of India (1.2) was published in two volumes by the Government of India. It contains over 600 compound Ayurvedic formulations.</li>
									<li>In 1999, Part I of the Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia of India was published by the Government of India. To date, five volumes have been published.</li>

								</ul>
								<p>
									Ayurveda describes the beneficial, nonbeneficial, happy and unhappy aspects of life.
									Health is defined as the state of equilibrium of dosha (humours), agni(digestive juices, enzymes and hormones), 
									dhatu (tissues) and the normal excretion of mala (waste materials), along with a happy state of atma (soul), indriya (sensory and motor organs), and manas (mind). 
								</p>
								<p>
									Rigveda (2000 BC) is the oldest recorded document regarding use of plants as 
									medicine in India, and this tradition continued in another ancient text, 
									Atharvaveda (1500-1000 BC), which described more plants and introduced basic concepts.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 1000 BC, Punarvasu Atreya (head of the school of medicine) and Divodas Dhanvantari (head of the school of surgery) imparted knowledge and practical training to their students. 
									The brilliant scholars of these schools faithfully documented the precepts of their masters in their compendia, popularly known as the Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita, respectively.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita are the basic scriptures of Ayurveda, 
									but they are supplemented by thousands of additions based on observation and 
									experience, none of which affect the sanctity of the basic texts.
								</p>
								<p><strong>2. Concepts and fundamental principles </strong></p>
								<p>
									Ayurveda is based on the principle that the entire universe and the human body 
									are one, and that the same principles govern both. The changes that occur in the 
									universe with the passage of time also occur in the human body. Hence, 
									substances of natural origin are congenial to the human body and help to 
									maintain the balance of its constituents. Both the universe and the human body 
									are made up of five elements. A balanced state of these elements in the body 
									brings health, and an imbalance brings disease.
								</p>
								<p><strong>
									The elemental composition of the body is explained in the theory of dosha, dhatu and mala, which is the foundation of Ayurveda.
									The aim of Ayurveda is to achieve equilibrium between doshas and dhatus, which is believed to bring health and longevity. </strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									The Ayurvedic concepts of physiology, pathology, diagnosis, medicine and therapeutics are based on the doctrine of tridoshas: vata, pitta and kapha.
									They are designated as doshas because of their capacity to vitiate other doshas and also as dhatus as they support the body. 
									The doshas are present in every cell and move through every channel of the body. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Ayurveda aims to maintain or resume equilibrium of dosha, dhatu and mala,patency of srotas (channels), and a healthy state of the agni.
								  	</strong>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>tridoshas : doshas in their normal state are the main supports of the body.</li>
									<ul>
										<li>vata: activities of the nervous system are governed by vata.</li>
										<li>pitta: thermogenic and endocrine/exocrine glandular activities are governed by pitta.</li>
										<li>kapha: musculoskeletal and anabolic system activities are governed by kapha.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>dhatus:  When normally disposed, the dhatus are in their “prasada” state, i.e. fit for building substances of the body.</li>
									<ul>
										<li>rasa (nutritive elements constituting the end product of gastrointestinal digestion - chyle, lymph, tissue fluid etc.).</li>
										<li>rakta (blood).</li>
										<li>mamsa (muscle tissue).</li>
										<li>medas (adipose tissue).</li>
										<li>asthi (cartilage and osseous tissue).</li>
										<li>majja (red bone marrow).</li>
										<li>shukra (reproductive elements).</li>
										
									</ul>
									<li>mala: the agni (biofire) corresponds to various digestive juices, enzymes, hormones etc, involved in digestion and metabolism.</li>
									<ul>
										<li>mutra (urine).</li>
										<li>purisha (faeces).</li>
										<li>sveda (sweat).</li>	
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>3. Ayurvedic pharmacology : Principles of Dravyaguna </strong></p>
								<p>
									In cases of disease or imbalance of dosha, dhatu and mala, the rational use of naturally available substances, including whole plants or their parts,
									animal parts and minerals, are used as medicines, either alone or in combination aims to restore normality. 
									These substances act on the principles of samanya (homologous/generality) and visesha (antagonistic/particularity) action. 
									Substances possessing homologous properties and actions increase the relevant elemental properties or constituents of the body while those having antagonistic 
									properties or actions decrease those properties or constituents.
								</p>
								<p><strong> The composition of elements in medicines and the diet is studied in terms of various properties, referred to as rasa, guna, virya, vipaka and prabhava. 
										The effect and action of the medicines or diet depends on these properties.</strong>
								</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Rasa (taste): a property of a medicine detected by the tongue. Six tastes are as follows;</li>
											<ul>
												<li>sweet (madhura).</li><li>sour (amla).</li><li>salty (lavana).</li><li>pungent (katu).</li><li>bitter (tikta).</li><li>astringent (kashaya).</li>
											</ul>
										<li>Guna: a property of a medicine detected by sense organs other than the tongue (faeces). Ten pairs are as follows;</li>
											<ul>
												<li>heavy (guru)/light (laghu).</li>
												<li>dull (manda)/sharp (tikshna).</li>
												<li>cold (sita)/hot (ushna).</li>
												<li>unctuous (snigdha)/non-unctuous (ruksha).</li>
												<li>smooth (slakshna)/rough (khara).</li>
												<li>immobile (sthira)/mobile (sara).</li>
												<li>soft (mridu)/hard (kathina).</li>
												<li>clear (visada)/slimy (picchila).</li>
												<li>solid (sandra)/fluid (drava).</li>
												<li>bulky (sthula)/fine (sukshma).</li>
											</ul>
										

										<li>Virya: denotes the potency of the medicine. Eight viryas representing the active gunas divided into two categories;</li>
											<ul><li>sita (cooling).</li><li>ushna (heating).</li></ul>
										<li>Vipaka: denotes the state of the rasas after digestion as demonstrated by their action. There are three vipakas.</li>
											<ul><li>A sweet taste becomes madhura vipaka.</li><li>sour and salty tastes become amla vipaka.</li><li>pungent, bitter and astringent tastes become katu vipaka.</li></ul>
												
										<li>Prabhava: a special property of some medicines, which cannot be explained by their elemental composition.</li>	
									</ul>
